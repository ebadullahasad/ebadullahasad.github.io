# What is a Transitive Closure Of a Graph.

Transitive Closure it the reachability matrix to reach from vertex u to vertex v of a graph. One graph is given, we have to find a vertex v which is reachable from another vertex u, for all vertex pairs (u, v).The final matrix is the Boolean type. When there is a value 1 for vertex u to vertex v, it means that there is at least one path from u to v.
